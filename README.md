# ðŸ“Œ Projects
## My first projects
ðŸ›  **FaS TeK Quiz Game**, was our very first initiative in the Start Coding Club. It is one of the most educational and entertaining games, allowing you to learn in a fun and engaging way. You can choose from various categories, such as history, religion, or science. To make the game more competitive and exciting, you can define your playing level. In each category, there are 10 questions, and for each question, there are three possible answers â€” only one of which is correct.

ðŸ“š **El-Bayan Library** â€“ A simple web page designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It features a collection of books and inspirational quotes, and allows users to download the books.
